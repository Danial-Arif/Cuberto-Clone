  # 🖥️ Cuberto Homepage Clone  

  This is my **beginner attempt** at recreating [Cuberto’s](https://cuberto.com/) homepage as a **clone** using **Next.js**.  
  It’s **just the home page** (no other pages yet), built mainly to practice frontend development.  

  I also used a little help from **AI** and some "vibe coding" here and there 😅.
